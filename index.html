              <p class="card-text">This show is exactly what it sounds like. Introducing a man named Saitama who can beat his opponents with just one punch. He is so powerful that he grows tired of fighting the same opponent throughout his life. 
                Because it's not very entertaining when a person like him can beat up opponents with just one punch, is it? Regardless, Saitama has a golden heart, and we follow his everyday adventures as a hero, as the man who one-punches his opponents, in this series.
                It remains appealing and fun because to Saitama's regular exploits. These adventures take him to new locations, into combat with new foes, and into partnerships with new companions.</p>

              <p class="card-text">"Not all men are created equal. This was the truth of society that I discovered when I was four years old."
                Thus starts the voyage of Izuku "Deku" Midoriya, a dreamer whose ambition is to emulate his idol and role model, the Symbol of Peace, the one and only All Might.
                There was never any doubt that My Hero Academia would divide fans' perspectives for all the wrong-headed but unavoidable reasons.
                In the world of My Hero Academia, quirks have become the norm. Nowadays, the majority of people born on the planet comprise the 80 percent of the population who inexplicably develop supernatural powers known as Quirks. Quirks can range from a person's personality 
                to heredity, and there is no clear explanation for how the powers emerge within a human body. This is the manner of life depicted in the anime, and it focuses around Izuku, who is now one of those rare cases where there is no trace of a Quirk developing in his body.</p>

                The anime contains not just great fighting, but also a lot of dialogue that will make you go into a deep thoughts and meanings. There are also many other elements in the anime, such as half-hearted, amusing scenes as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime contains a lot of gore 
                and will regularly crush your heart.</p>

              <p class="card-text">It has a terrific plot and doesn't reliant on pyrotechnics or large breasted women to keep things moving; Some may find the first couple of episodes cheesy, and they are pretty generic, but stay with it.
                This isn't a kid's entertainment; it's rather adult and gloomy (just the right amount though). Story may seem to revolve aroudn the main character i.e. "Gon" but thats not the case, instead of being all about Gon, other characters receive some time in the limelight as well.
                 Everyone gets enough character development, even those who die soon after they emerge</p>

              <p class="card-text">One of the series that characterised the last generation's cultural shonen in anime history. This is a series that has evolved dramatically over the last decade. Naruto is the show's whole "Ninja component." Every technique had substance and quality, and all of 
                the training arcs truly demonstrated the distinguishing features of how ninjutsu operated in the Naruto universe. The protagonists in this book were children in every sense of the word, growing up in a world full of adults who were far more competent ninjas in terms of both abilities and battle.
                That is not to argue that the show was designed for youngsters. Just that Kishi intended to present the younger generation as the program's major characters and the older age as training shinobi. They had to learn the ins and outs of becoming a ninja. Following their pre-training sessions, they were 
                ultimately put to the test of how harsh the world is and how they must utilise every ounce of their being to live and defend those they care about.</p>

This hsow is a combination of ecchi, action, and enjoyment It features a good narrative and interesting characters, notably Rias, who will captivate you with their distinct characteristics. The ecchi moments are very amusing. 
                Some argue that the ecchi is overblown, particularly the image of Issei being a pervert, but as you watch the anime, you will notice that he is a lovely lad who does his best to manage his wants with females (but he fails numerous times).</p>

Tanijro is a breath of fresh air in this shounen setting because he does not
                 have lofty goals like becoming king of pirates or something like that, he just wants to turn his sister back to human form once more and he does not rely on friendship power or activating his fourth gear or going ssj 3, nope he trains like any other human being to earn his power. The directing on this anime is also intriguing; 
                 you can see that the director spared no expense for battle scenes and went all out to create those stunning combat scenes.</p>

As a result, Yuuji Itadori becomes the host of the curse Sukuna.
                The anime is a blend of action, horror, and adventure. It also has some fairly dramatic and intriguing backstories.
                Not only does it have a powerful MC, but other characters play an important role in the anime as well, thus it does not centre just upon the protagonist.
                It features beautiful animation and a solid narrative. So you won't be sorry if you watch it.</p>

              <p class="card-text">Dealing with the death of a friend or loved one is difficult no matter your age, and everyone copes with their loss in various ways. Adults can drink themselves into a stupor, embark on a voyage of self-discovery, immerse themselves in their profession, or find another coping method. 
                Unfortunately, this is not true for youngsters, who are often unable to deal with the emotional turbulence that happens.AnoHana is a fairly basic, though rather emotional, look at the coping processes of children and teenagers when dealing with a prior tragedy, and it's one of the more surprise titles 
                of the last few years in that regard. The series occasionally veers more toward soap opera than straight drama, but this, like many of the other small problems, can be overlooked given how wonderfully the subject matter is handled and conveyed.</p>

Even if you're simply a casual fan of anime, you've most definitely heard of the long-running programme since 1999. With a programme this long and with such rich background behind it, one needs to really evaluate 
                if it's worth the time investment to get to the finish..One Piece is the narrative of the daring Monkey D. Luffy, a teenage pirate who dreams of discovering the mythical treasure known as the "One Piece" and becoming King of the Pirates. He has a long trip ahead of him, navigating treacherous waters and battling great opponents in 
                the Navy who want to put an end to the age of pirates, as well as other pirate groups that want to control the high seas. Luffy sets off with his trusted crew to pursue his aspirations and make his own reputation.</p>
